Let’s Get You Better Acquainted with Us
Why should I introduce AI education to my child?
AI has revolutionised various aspects of our world, permeating every corner of our lives. As our world becomes increasingly AI-driven, the ability to understand, use, and even develop AI becomes a fundamental life skill comparable to essential skills such as mathematics or swimming. When you introduce your child to AI, you are helping them open many career opportunities for them in the coming years.
Does my child require any previous coding experience to enrol with JetLearn?
No prior coding experience is required for your child to enrol with JetLearn. We customise the learning experience based on their interests and learning pace, ensuring a smooth introduction to coding.
What is the recommended age for a child to learn AI, robotics, and coding?
Children can start learning coding as early as 5-6 years old. Starting early helps them learn better and faster due to their natural curiosity and quick learning abilities.
How do I know which course to choose for my child?
We offer trial classes to assess your child's interests, learning pace, and experience. Based on this assessment, we recommend the best-suited course and learning path for your child.
Is JetLearn's course schedule flexible?
JetLearn's course schedule is flexible and personalised to fit your child's needs. You can arrange classes at your convenience and set a pace that suits your child.
Can I stop my subscription anytime?
You can stop your subscription anytime by providing a month's notice. This gives you flexibility and peace of mind as you manage your child's learning journey.

AI has revolutionised various aspects of our world, permeating every corner of our lives. As our world becomes increasingly AI-driven, the ability to understand, use, and even develop AI becomes a fundamental life skill comparable to essential skills such as mathematics or swimming. When you introduce your child to AI, you are helping them open many career opportunities for them in the coming years.
Does my child require any previous coding experience to enrol with JetLearn?
No prior coding experience is required for your child to enrol with JetLearn. We customise the learning experience based on their interests and learning pace, ensuring a smooth introduction to coding.
What is the recommended age for a child to learn AI, robotics, and coding?
Children can start learning coding as early as 5-6 years old. Starting early helps them learn better and faster due to their natural curiosity and quick learning abilities.
How do I know which course to choose for my child?
We offer trial classes to assess your child's interests, learning pace, and experience. Based on this assessment, we recommend the best-suited course and learning path for your child.
Is JetLearn's course schedule flexible?
JetLearn's course schedule is flexible and personalised to fit your child's needs. You can arrange classes at your convenience and set a pace that suits your child.
Can I stop my subscription anytime?
You can stop your subscription anytime by providing a month's notice. This gives you flexibility and peace of mind as you manage your child's learning journey.

Let’s Get You Better Acquainted with Us
Why should I introduce AI education to my child?
AI has revolutionised various aspects of our world, permeating every corner of our lives. As our world becomes increasingly AI-driven, the ability to understand, use, and even develop AI becomes a fundamental life skill comparable to essential skills such as mathematics or swimming. When you introduce your child to AI, you are helping them open many career opportunities for them in the coming years.
Does my child require any previous coding experience to enrol with JetLearn?

Course Outline
Roblox
I
covers Game design and development including concepts of Lua whereas Roblox
II
helps learners do advanced scripting and designing.
Design and engineering
The initial step for the learners is to understand the designing and engineering concepts used in Roblox Studio, which helps them develop their critical thinking and
cognitive skills.
Innovation and Game based fun learning environment
Roblox Studio boasts a templated and interactive environment. Its easy-to-use aesthetic allows learners to create games with customised tools and logical scripting. It imparts knowledge of 3D virtual designing with concepts of coordinates understanding. Plugins are specialised to enhance the UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) of games. It enumerates a variety of gaming styles to create like racing, obstacle games, and animations.
Game-based learning meets students where they are and where they want to be. It simulates adventure, keeps the learner engaged both logically & creatively and hence increases overall
computational thinking abilities.
Programming with LUA
Lua
-  is a scripting language, very similar to python. It will bring scripting abilities on top of the language itself. It is very portable, small, and simple to use . It focuses more on the problem that we are solving rather than syntax. Hence, one of the best languages to start your coding journey with.
STEM - Physics and engineering
There is interactive physics in Roblox
, which makes the game world more real, teaching applied physics concepts. Advanced concepts of physics such as shadows, gravity, and hinges are add-ons. Students can develop their STEM skills while coding in a fun-learning way. STEM learning gives learners opportunities to investigate an idea in different contexts and connect the learning across disciplines.

JetLearn partnered with INSEAD, one of the world's leading and largest graduate business schools, to design and conduct live workshops at its prestigious summer boot camp for 200 high-school students.
We spoke with students to better understand their views on coding and how they believe it is essential for their future career plans to build  a technical entrepreneurship.
JetLearn has partnered with TISA School, which conducts a biannual conference where its students (5 to 12 years old) present their business projects to the expert community.
We are proud to be associated with such a dynamic and inspiring institution. We provide our e-learning platform and content to the students to help them prepare for their presentations.
JetLearn partnered with Leiden University to update the programming language Hedy with Hindi and Bengali translations, making it accessible to 800+ million children.
Hedy is developed to bridge the gap between visual language to introduce children to programming, like Scratch, to real programming language, like Python.
JetLearn was invited to conduct a webinar about the importance of technology in the rapidly changing world and how we can empower our children to be future creators — seeing the interest and insightful questions from the OIS community energised and motivated us to continue our mission.
JetLearn partnered with ISD to nudge young minds towards coding in a fun and engaging way. A set of 2 courses was designed in accordance with ISD’s requirements.‍
1. The first course had the theme “Space Exploration” designed to introduce Robotics to kids. Students build a Scratch-based simulated programme to control Mars Rover.
2. The second course was themed around “Environment and Sustainability” and was designed to teach fundamentals of Python and Artificial Intelligence.
JetLearn’s Partnerships with  Corporates
We partner with leading corporates to offer exclusive tech education programmes for their employees’ children, equipping them with essential skills in AI, robotics, & coding to thrive in tomorrow’s tech world.
JetLearn partnered with Shell to conduct a program aimed at helping parents understand the importance of tech education for their children.
Together, we emphasized the role of coding, AI, and robotics in shaping a child’s future in a tech-driven world.
JetLearn teamed up with Barclays, where Abhishek Bahl, the CEO and Founder of JetLearn, led a presentation on the importance of coding for kids.
The session highlighted how coding builds problem-solving  skills but and prepares children to excel in any profession they choose in future.
JetLearn and Instrucko have joined forces to create a dynamic learning environment where children can master both tech and language skills.
We’re shaping well-rounded, future-ready learners who can thrive in an interconnected world by combining AI, robotics, & coding with language education.
We have partnered with Redkite Days to help UK parents and children understand the transformative power of tech education.
Through this collaboration, we’re educating families on the importance of AI, robotics, and coding education, showing how these skills can open up diverse career opportunities.
JetLearn’s Partnerships with  NGOs
JetLearn works with NGOs to bring the power of tech education to underprivileged children, giving them the chance to break barriers and build brighter futures through coding, AI, and robotics.
Through our partnership with Donate an Hour, JetLearn’s expert leaders and teachers dedicate their time and expertise to shaping the lives of underserved children.
They help unlock the potential of these young minds, opening doors to a brighter future in the tech world by offering free  classes and workshops in tech education.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is JetGirls and who is it designed for?
JetGirls is a specialized (an initiative by JetLearn) tech education program crafted for girls aged 6-16. The program teaches coding, AI, and machine learning through age-appropriate groups: Early Learners (6-8), Middle School (10-14), and High School (14-16). Each group receives a personalised learning to match their developmental stage and learning needs.
How is the program structured and what will my daughter learn?
The program is built on three foundational pillars: Bravery, Sisterhood, and Leadership. Your daughter will develop technical skills in coding and AI while building confidence through hands-on projects. The curriculum combines practical coding education with mentorship, community building, and leadership development opportunities, ensuring a well-rounded tech education experience.
What makes JetGirls different from other coding programs?
JetGirls stands out through its unique combination of technical education and community building. With 50% higher retention rates among female students, our program offers near-peer mentoring, industry exposure, and strong parent engagement. We create an inclusive environment where girls can thrive, supported by specially trained teachers and an adaptive curriculum.
What prior experience does my daughter need to join?
No prior coding or tech experience is needed to join JetGirls. We assess each student's current abilities and create a personalized learning path that matches their level. Our experienced teachers adapt the curriculum to ensure every learner can progress at their own pace while building confidence in their technical abilities.
How do you ensure the learning environment is supportive for girls?
We create a safe, nurturing environment through trained teachers who specialize in girls' tech education. Our program incorporates female role models, peer support networks, and project-based learning that encourages experimentation. This judgment-free space allows girls to build confidence while developing their technical skills.
What kind of support and resources are available for parents?
Parents receive comprehensive support through our progress tracking dashboard, regular updates via our Class Progress Report System, and access to parent workshops and community events. We provide educational resources for at-home learning and maintain consistent communication between teachers, mentors, and families.
What are the technical requirements for participating?
The program requires a computer with a larger screen for main coding activities, though younger learners (6-7 years) can access tablet-optimized content. We provide technical support throughout the program and ensure all necessary tools are accessible for optimal learning experiences.
How do you measure and track learner progress?
Learner progress is monitored through our Class Progress Report System, which tracks both technical skills and personal growth. We evaluate progress through project completions, and portfolio development, ensuring each learner is meeting their learning goals and developing essential skills.
What career and mentorship opportunities are available?
Our program provides robust career development through industry exposure, mentorship from female tech leaders, and specialized career pathway guidance. High school students receive additional support in portfolio development and leadership training, preparing them for future opportunities in technology.
How can we get started with JetGirls?
Starting with JetGirls begins with a trial session to assess your daughter's current level and interests. We offer bi-monthly webinars on the 2nd and 4th Sundays for program introduction. Our team will help place your daughter in the appropriate age group and skill level, ensuring she starts her tech journey on the right path.
